/**
 * Throws any fatal exceptions. This is a re-implementation taken from Arrow's
 * [`nonFatalOrThrow`](https://apidocs.arrow-kt.io/arrow-core/arrow.core/non-fatal-or-throw.html) â€“
 * not because it is bad, it is actually pretty much perfect.
 * However, the arrow dependency triggered an obscure IDEA bug, resulting in `NoClasDefFoundErrors` instead of correct
 * behaviour.  * We therefore removed the dependency and added the functionality directly to KmmResult.
 *
 * Please note that this was never a problem building anything that depended on KmmResult, it only made debugging
 * in IDEA a nightmare.
